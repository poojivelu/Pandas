📦 E-Commerce Data Analysis Project

Exploring Online Retail Dataset using Python & Pandas

📌 Project Overview
This project performs an end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) on an E-Commerce Online Retail dataset using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
The goal is to understand customer purchasing patterns, stock-keeping unit (SKU) performance, sales trends, and data quality issues within transactional retail data.

The analysis covers data loading, cleaning, preprocessing, visualization, and generating meaningful insights that help stakeholders make data-driven business decisions.
